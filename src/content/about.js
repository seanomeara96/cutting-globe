      content: [
        `Plant Propagation & The Cutting Globe:The cutting globe facilitates a propagation method called air layering that has been 
    used for over 4000 years (tried and tested). The small globe is designed to take cuttings from climbers and long stemmed slim plants. 
      The large globe is designed to take larger cuttings from shrubs and trees.`,
        `The Cutting Globe  Airlayering with the cutting globe is so simple, it can be done by anyone.  
      What you are basically doing is cloning a plant. While this sounds like science fiction it is one of the oldest 
      methods of multiplying plants known ever recorded.  The cutting globe aims to teach people that they don't need to buy plants
      and trees that they already have access to. They can simply take a limb and turn it into a entirely separate plant in as little as 6-8 weeks!`,

      title: "Why use The Cutting Globe",
      content: [
        `For over 4000 years gardeners have been air-layering plants and shrubs with great success. Bonsai masters have perfected this method of propagation and continue to this day to use it with great success. There are many advantages to using the cutting globe to airlayer your trees and shrubs etc. The predrilled holes give you a good root to stem ratio for your plants to develop once removed from the globe. Ideal for indoor plants that have grown leggy through the loss of lower foliage and for plants that are hard to root with traditional forms of propagation. The size of your cutting can be a lot bigger than what you can expect when using a traditional method, therefore saving you years in growing time. Some plants take years to flower and fruit but with this method and with your new cutting globe, your plant will flower or fruit in its first year . You can have several cutting globes on any one plant. For hydroponics you can substitute soil for rockwool or sponge.Type your paragraph here.`,
